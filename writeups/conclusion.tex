\section{Conclusion}

\todo{summarize what we did and showed}


Future work includes an evaluation from the surfer's side, i.e. whether we can accuratly predict by which host he is going to be accepted. Further, we would like to investigate the benefits of modeling more dependencies across user properties and preferences (possibly using kernels), i.e. whether age influences preferences in gender or whether a host that wants to travel to a certain country likes to host surfers from that country. We plan to evaluate whether our recommender system leads to a higher acceptance rate in the deployed system at CouchSurfing. Using this system we also want to explore more the temporal structure in the data better, i.e. whether both parties communicated before the request, were already friends, or whether the couch was already booked for the requested time slot or still available etc. The latter information could be used to filter the training data because the only reason for the rejection might have been the unavailalability of the host or his couch.
\todo{more ideas for future work?}
