In this review, rather than stating what is known, we attempt to estimate how much is still unknown about V1 function. In particular, we identify five problems with the current view of V1 that stem largely from experimental and theoretical biases, in addition to the contributions of nonlinearities in the cortex that are not well understood. Our purpose is to open the door to new theories, a number of which we describe, along with some proposals for testing them.},

@article{Kersten2004a,
abstract = {We perceive the shapes and material properties of objects quickly and reliably despite the complexity and objective ambiguities of natural images. Typical images are highly complex because they consist of many objects embedded in background clutter. Moreover, the image features of an object are extremely variable and ambiguous owing to the effects of projection, occlusion, background clutter, and illumination. The very success of everyday vision implies neural mechanisms, yet to be understood, that discount irrelevant information and organize ambiguous or noisy local image features into objects and surfaces. Recent work in Bayesian theories of visual perception has shown how complexity may be managed and ambiguity resolved through the task-dependent, probabilistic integration of prior object knowledge with image features.},

abstract = {Progress in understanding the brain mechanisms underlying vision requires the construction of computational models that not only emulate the brain's anatomy and physiology, but ultimately match its performance on visual tasks. In recent years, "natural" images have become popular in the study of vision and have been used to show apparently impressive progress in building such models. Here, we challenge the use of uncontrolled "natural" images in guiding that progress. In particular, we show that a simple V1-like model--a neuroscientist's "null" model, which should perform poorly at real-world visual object recognition tasks--outperforms state-of-the-art object recognition systems (biologically inspired and otherwise) on a standard, ostensibly natural image recognition test. As a counterpoint, we designed a "simpler" recognition test to better span the real-world variation in object pose, position, and scale, and we show that this test correctly exposes the inadequacy of the V1-like model. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tests based on uncontrolled natural images can be seriously misleading, potentially guiding progress in the wrong direction. Instead, we reexamine what it means for images to be natural and argue for a renewed focus on the core problem of object recognition--real-world image variation.},

abstract = {The problem of color constancy may be solved if we can recover the physical properties of illuminants and surfaces from photosensor responses. We consider this problem within the framework of Bayesian decision theory. First, we model the relation among illuminants, surfaces, and photosensor responses. Second, we construct prior distributions that describe the probability that particular illuminants and surfaces exist in the world. Given a set of photosensor responses, we can then use Bayes's rule to compute the posterior distribution for the illuminants and the surfaces in the scene. There are two widely used methods for obtaining a single best estimate from a posterior distribution. These are maximum a posteriori (MAP) and minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) estimation. We argue that neither is appropriate for perception problems. We describe a new estimator, which we call the maximum local mass (MLM) estimate, that integrates local probability density. The new method uses an optimality criterion that is appropriate for perception tasks: It finds the most probable approximately correct answer. For the case of low observation noise, we provide an efficient approximation. We develop the MLM estimator for the color-constancy problem in which flat matte surfaces are uniformly illuminated. In simulations we show that the MLM method performs better than the MAP estimator and better than a number of standard color-constancy algorithms. We note conditions under which even the optimal estimator produces poor estimates: when the spectral properties of the surfaces in the scene are biased.},

abstract = {The biological plausibility of statistical inference and learning, tuned to the statistics of natural images, is investigated. It is shown that a rich family of statistical decision rules, confidence measures, and risk estimates, can be implemented with the computations attributed to the standard neurophysiological model of V1. In particular, different statistical quantities can be computed through simple re-arrangement of lateral divisive connections, non-linearities, and pooling. It is then shown that a number of proposals for the measurement of visual saliency can be implemented in a biologically plausible manner, through such re-arrangements. This enables the implementation of biologically plausible feedforward object recognition networks that include explicit saliency models. The potential of combined attention and recognition is illustrated by replacing the first layer of the HMAX architecture with a saliency network. Various saliency measures are compared, to investigate whether (1) saliency can substantially benefit visual recognition and (2) the benefits depend on the specific saliency mechanisms implemented. Experimental evaluation shows that saliency does indeed enhance recognition, but the gains are not independent of the saliency mechanisms. Best results are obtained with top-down mechanisms that equate saliency to classification confidence.},

abstract = {This paper studies automatic image classification by modeling soft assignment in the popular codebook model. The codebook model describes an image as a bag of discrete visual words selected from a vocabulary, where the frequency distributions of visual words in an image allow classification. One inherent component of the codebook model is the assignment of discrete visual words to continuous image features. Despite the clear mismatch of this hard assignment with the nature of continuous features, the approach has been successfully applied for some years. In this paper, we investigate four types of soft assignment of visual words to image features. We demonstrate that explicitly modeling visual word assignment ambiguity improves classification performance compared to the hard assignment of the traditional codebook model. The traditional codebook model is compared against our method for five well-known data sets: 15 natural scenes, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, and Pascal VOC 2007/2008. We demonstrate that large codebook vocabulary sizes completely deteriorate the performance of the traditional model, whereas the proposed model performs consistently. Moreover, we show that our method profits in high-dimensional feature spaces and reaps higher benefits when increasing the number of image categories.},

abstract = {Computer vision has grown tremendously in the past two decades. Despite all efforts, existing attempts at matching parts of the human visual system's extraordinary ability to understand visual scenes lack either scope or power. By combining the advantages of general low-level generative models and powerful layer-based and hierarchical models, this work aims at being a first step toward richer, more flexible models of images. After comparing various types of restricted Baltzman machines (RBMs) able to model continuous-valued data, we introduce our basic model, the masked RBM, which explicitly models occlusion boundaries in image patches by factoring the appearance of any patch region from its shape. We then propose a generative model of larger images using a field of such RBMs. Finally, we discuss how masked RBMs could be stacked to form a deep model able to generate more complicated structures and suitable for various tasks such as segmentation or object recognition.},

abstract = {Interpreting real-world images requires the ability distinguish the different characteristics of the scene that lead to its final appearance. Two of the most important of these characteristics are the shading and reflectance of each point in the scene. We present an algorithm that uses multiple cues to recover shading and reflectance intrinsic images from a single image. Using both color information and a classifier trained to recognize gray-scale patterns, given the lighting direction, each image derivative is classified as being caused by shading or a change in the surface's reflectance. The classifiers gather local evidence about the surface's form and color, which is then propagated using the Generalized Belief Propagation algorithm. The propagation step disambiguates areas of the image where the correct classification is not clear from local evidence. We use real-world images to demonstrate results and show how each component of the system affects the results.},

abstract = {Capturing statistical regularities in complex, high-dimensional data is an important problem in machine learning and signal processing. Models such as principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) make few assumptions about the structure in the data and have good scaling properties, but they are limited to representing linear statistical regularities and assume that the distribution of the data is stationary. For many natural, complex signals, the latent variables often exhibit residual dependencies as well as nonstationary statistics. Here we present a hierarchical Bayesian model that is able to capture higher-order nonlinear structure and represent nonstationary data distributions. The model is a generalization of ICA in which the basis function coefficients are no longer assumed to be independent; instead, the dependencies in their magnitudes are captured by a set of density components. Each density component describes a common pattern of deviation from the marginal density of the pattern ensemble; in different combinations, they can describe nonstationary distributions. Adapting the model to image or audio data yields a nonlinear, distributed code for higher-order statistical regularities that reflect more abstract, invariant properties of the signal.},

abstract = {A fundamental function of the visual system is to encode the building blocks of natural scenes-edges, textures and shapes-that subserve visual tasks such as object recognition and scene understanding. Essential to this process is the formation of abstract representations that generalize from specific instances of visual input. A common view holds that neurons in the early visual system signal conjunctions of image features, but how these produce invariant representations is poorly understood. Here we propose that to generalize over similar images, higher-level visual neurons encode statistical variations that characterize local image regions. We present a model in which neural activity encodes the probability distribution most consistent with a given image. Trained on natural images, the model generalizes by learning a compact set of dictionary elements for image distributions typically encountered in natural scenes. Model neurons show a diverse range of properties observed in cortical cells. These results provide a new functional explanation for nonlinear effects in complex cells and offer insight into coding strategies in primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas.},

abstract = {How do we learn to recognize visual categories, such as dogs and cats? Somehow, the brain uses limited variable examples to extract the essential characteristics of new visual categories. Here, I describe an approach to category learning and recognition that is based on recent computational advances. In this approach, objects are represented by a hierarchy of fragments that are extracted during learning from observed examples. The fragments are class-specific features and are selected to deliver a high amount of information for categorization. The same fragments hierarchy is then used for general categorization, individual object recognition and object-parts identification. Recognition is also combined with object segmentation, using stored fragments, to provide a top-down process that delineates object boundaries in complex cluttered scenes. The approach is computationally effective and provides a possible framework for categorization, recognition and segmentation in human vision.},

@article{Torralba2008,
abstract = {With the advent of the Internet, billions of images are now freely available online and constitute a dense sampling of the visual world. Using a variety of non-parametric methods, we explore this world with the aid of a large dataset of 79,302,017 images collected from the Internet. Motivated by psychophysical results showing the remarkable tolerance of the human visual system to degradations in image resolution, the images in the dataset are stored as 32 x 32 color images. Each image is loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract nouns in English, as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. Hence the image database gives a comprehensive coverage of all object categories and scenes. The semantic information from Wordnet can be used in conjunction with nearest-neighbor methods to perform object classification over a range of semantic levels minimizing the effects of labeling noise. For certain classes that are particularly prevalent in the dataset, such as people, we are able to demonstrate a recognition performance comparable to class-specific Viola-Jones style detectors.},

@article{Bell1999a,
abstract = {In discussing artificial intelligence and neuroscience, I will focus on two themes. The first is the universality of cycles (or loops): sets of variables that affect each other in such a way that any feed-forward account of causality and control, while informative, is misleading. The second theme is based around the observation that a computer is an intrinsically dualistic entity, with its physical set-up designed so as not to interfere with its logical set-up, which executes the computation. The brain is different. When analysed empirically at several different levels (cellular, molecular), it appears that there is no satisfactory way to separate a physical brain model (or algorithm, or representation), from a physical implementational substrate. When program and implementation are inseparable and thus interfere with each other, a dualistic point-of-view is impossible. Forced by empiricism into a monistic perspective, the brain-mind appears as neither embodied by or embedded in physical reality, but rather as identical to physical reality. This perspective has implications for the future of science and society. I will approach these from a negative point-of-view, by critiquing some of our millennial culture's popular projected futures.},

abstract = {The pattern of local image velocities on the retina encodes important environmental information. Although humans are generally able to extract this information, they can easily be deceived into seeing incorrect velocities. We show that these 'illusions' arise naturally in a system that attempts to estimate local image velocity. We formulated a model of visual motion perception using standard estimation theory, under the assumptions that (i) there is noise in the initial measurements and (ii) slower motions are more likely to occur than faster ones. We found that specific instantiation of such a velocity estimator can account for a wide variety of psychophysical phenomena.},

abstract = {Layered representations for object recognition are important due to their increased invariance, biological plausibility, and computational benefits. However, most of existing approaches to hierarchical representations are strictly feedforward, and thus not well able to resolve local ambiguities. We propose a probabilistic model that learns and infers all layers of the hierarchy jointly. Specifically, we suggest a process of recursive probabilistic factorization, and present a novel generative model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation to this end. The approach is tested on a standard recognition dataset, outperforming existing hierarchical approaches and demonstrating performance on par with current single-feature state-of-the-art models. We demonstrate two important properties of our proposed model: 1) adding an additional layer to the representation increases performance over the flat model; 2) a full Bayesian approach outperforms a feedforward implementation of the model.},

@article{Karklin2003a,
abstract = {The theoretical principles that underlie the representation and computation of higher-order structure in natural images are poorly understood. Recently, there has been considerable interest in using information theoretic techniques, such as independent component analysis, to derive representations for natural images that are optimal in the sense of coding efficiency. Although these approaches have been successful in explaining properties of neural representations in the early visual pathway and visual cortex, because they are based on a linear model, the types of image structure that can be represented are very limited. Here, we present a hierarchical probabilistic model for learning higher-order statistical regularities in natural images. This non-linear model learns an efficient code that describes variations in the underlying probabilistic density. When applied to natural images the algorithm yields coarse-coded, sparse-distributed representations of abstract image properties such as object location, scale and texture. This model offers a novel description of higher-order image structure and could provide theoretical insight into the response properties and computational functions of lower level cortical visual areas.},

Surprisingly, little quantitative modeling has been done to explore the biological feasibility of this class of models to explain aspects of higher-level visual processing such as object recognition. We describe a new hierarchical model consistent with physiological data from inferotemporal cortex that accounts for this complex visual task and makes testable predictions. The model is based on a MAX-like operation applied to inputs to certain cortical neurons that may have a general role in cortical function.},

abstract = {This paper presents a family of probabilistic latent variable models that can be used for analysis of nonnegative data. We show that there are strong ties between nonnegative matrix factorization and this family, and provide some straightforward extensions which can help in dealing with shift invariances, higher-order decompositions and sparsity constraints. We argue through these extensions that the use of this approach allows for rapid development of complex statistical models for analyzing nonnegative data.},

@article{Ross2008,
abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a rich framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty in stochastic domains. However, solving a POMDP is often intractable except for small problems due to their complexity. Here, we focus on online approaches that alleviate the computational complexity by computing good local policies at each decision step during the execution. Online algorithms generally consist of a lookahead search to find the best action to execute at each time step in an environment. Our objectives here are to survey the various existing online POMDP methods, analyze their properties and discuss their advantages and disadvantages; and to thoroughly evaluate these online approaches in different environments under various metrics (return, error bound reduction, lower bound improvement). Our experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art online heuristic search methods can handle large POMDP domains efficiently.},

We describe a generative model for documents, introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan [Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y. & Jordan, M. I. (2003) J. Machine Learn. Res. 3, 993-1022], in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. We then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. We use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applications of this analysis, including identifying "hot topics" by examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content.},

abstract = {The classical receptive fields of simple cells in the visual cortex have been shown to emerge from the statistical properties of natural images by forcing the cell responses to be maximally sparse, i.e. significantly activated only rarely. Here, we show that this single principle of sparseness can also lead to emergence of topography (columnar organization) and complex cell properties as well. These are obtained by maximizing the sparsenesses of locally pooled energies, which correspond to complex cell outputs. Thus, we obtain a highly parsimonious model of how these properties of the visual cortex are adapted to the characteristics of the natural input.},

@article{Lee2003,
abstract = {Traditional views of visual processing suggest that early visual neurons in areas V1 and V2 are static spatiotemporal filters that extract local features from a visual scene. The extracted information is then channeled through a feedforward chain of modules in successively higher visual areas for further analysis. Recent electrophysiological recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework, the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief propagation might model these interactive cortical computations. We review some recent neurophysiological evidences that support the plausibility of these ideas.},

abstract = {We describe an object detection system based on mixtures of multiscale deformable part models. Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.},

abstract = {Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability distributions. However, learning the structure of a belief network, particularly one with hidden units, is difficult. The Indian buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the directed structure of a belief network with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. In this paper, we introduce the cascading Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a nonparametric prior on the structure of a layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief network so each unit can additionally vary its behavior between discrete and continuous representations. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in these belief networks and explore the structures learned on several image data sets.},

@article{Torralba2007,
abstract = {We consider the problem of detecting a large number of different classes of objects in cluttered scenes. Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by training each class separately tend to be more object-specific. The generic features generalize better and considerably reduce the computational cost of multiclass object detection.},

@article{Ferrari2008a,
abstract = {We present a family of scale-invariant local shape features formed by chains of k connected, roughly straight contour segments (kAS), and their use for object class detection. kAS are able to cleanly encode pure fragments of an object boundary, without including nearby clutter. Moreover, they offer an attractive compromise between information content and repeatability, and encompass a wide variety of local shape structures. We also define a translation and scale invariant descriptor encoding the geometric configuration of the segments within a kAS, making kAS easy to reuse in other frameworks, for example as a replacement or addition to interest points. Software for detecting and describing kAS is released on lear.inrialpes.fr/software. We demonstrate the high performance of kAS within a simple but powerful sliding-window object detection scheme. Through extensive evaluations, involving eight diverse object classes and more than 1400 images, we 1) study the evolution of performance as the degree of feature complexity k varies and determine the best degree; 2) show that kAS substantially outperform interest points for detecting shape-based classes; 3) compare our object detector to the recent, state-of-the-art system by Dalal and Triggs [4].},

abstract = {Visual input is segregated in the brain into subsystems that process different attributes such as motion and color. At the same time, visual information is perceptually segregated into objects and surfaces. Here we demonstrate that perceptual segregation of visual entities based on a transparency cue precedes and affects perceptual binding of attributes. Adding an irrelevant transparency cue paradoxically improved the pairing of color and motion for rapidly alternating surfaces. Subsequent experiments show: (1) Attributes are registered over the temporal window defined by the perceptual persistence of segregation, resulting in asynchrony in binding, and (2) attention is necessary for correct registration of attributes in the presence of ambiguity.},

@article{Bhanu1998,
abstract = {Current computer vision systems whose basic methodology is open-loop or filter type typically use image segmentation followed by object recognition algorithms. These systems are not robust for most real-world applications. In contrast, the system presented here achieves robust performance by using reinforcement learning to induce a mapping from input images to corresponding segmentation parameters. This is accomplished by using the confidence level of model matching as a reinforcement signal for a team of learning automata to search for segmentation parameters during training. The use of the recognition algorithm as part of the evaluation function for image segmentation gives rise to significant improvement of the system performance by automatic generation of recognition strategies. The system is verified through experiments on sequences of indoor and outdoor color images with varying external conditions},

abstract = {Selective visual attention is believed to be responsible for serializing visual information for recognizing one object at a time in a complex scene. But how can we attend to objects before they are recognized? In coherence theory of visual cognition, so-called proto-objects form volatile units of visual information that can be accessed by selective attention and subsequently validated as actual objects. We propose a biologically plausible model of forming and attending to proto-objects in natural scenes. We demonstrate that the suggested model can enable a model of object recognition in cortex to expand from recognizing individual objects in isolation to sequentially recognizing all objects in a more complex scene.},

abstract = {In the real world, objects never occur in isolation; they co-vary with other objects and particular environments, providing a rich source of contextual associations to be exploited by the visual system. A natural way of representing the context of an object is in terms of its relationship to other objects. Alternately, recent work has shown that a statistical summary of the scene provides a complementary and effective source of information for contextual inference, which enables humans to quickly guide their attention and eyes to regions of interest in natural scenes. A better understanding of how humans build such scene representations, and of the mechanisms of contextual analysis, will lead to a new generation of computer vision systems.},

@article{Shotton2008,
abstract = {Psychophysical studies [9], [17] show that we can recognize objects using fragments of outline contour alone. This paper proposes a new automatic visual recognition system based only on local contour features, capable of localizing objects in space and scale. The system first builds a class-specific codebook of local fragments of contour using a novel formulation of chamfer matching. These local fragments allow recognition that is robust to within-class variation, pose changes, and articulation. Boosting combines these fragments into a cascaded sliding-window classifier, and mean shift is used to select strong responses as a final set of detections. We show how learning can be performed iteratively on both training and test sets to boot-strap an improved classifier. We compare with other methods based on contour and local descriptors in our detailed evaluation over 17 challenging categories, and obtain highly competitive results. The results confirm that contour is indeed a powerful cue for multi-scale and multi-class visual object recognition.},

@article{Weiss2001,
abstract = {Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, represent statistical dependencies of variables by a graph. Local "belief propagation" rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphs. Recently, good performance has been obtained by using these same rules on graphs with loops, a method we refer to as loopy belief propagation. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of "Turbo codes," whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theoretical understanding of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges, it gives the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks with a single loop. These results motivate using the powerful belief propagation algorithm in a broader class of networks and help clarify the empirical performance results.},

abstract = {A theory of object recognition requires a theory of shape. Despite considerable empirical and theoretical research, however, a definition of object shape has proved elusive. Two experiments provide new insights by showing that children's object recognition changes dramatically during the period between 17 and 25 months. During this time, children develop the ability to recognize stylized three-dimensional caricatures of known and novel objects. This ability is linked to the number of object names in children's vocabularies, suggesting that category learning may be a driving force behind the developmental changes.},

abstract = {The goal of this work is to accurately detect and localize boundaries in natural scenes using local image measurements. We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images.},

abstract = {Accounts of subjective randomness suggest that people consider a stimulus random when they cannot detect any regularities characterizing the structure of that stimulus. We explored the possibility that the regularities people detect are shaped by the statistics of their natural environment. We did this by testing the hypothesis that people's perception of randomness in two-dimensional binary arrays (images with two levels of intensity) is inversely related to the probability with which the array's pattern would be encountered in nature. We estimated natural scene probabilities for small binary arrays by tabulating the frequencies with which each pattern of cell values appears. We then conducted an experiment in which we collected human randomness judgments. The results show an inverse relationship between people's perceived randomness of an array pattern and the probability of the pattern appearing in nature.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

Most of these comparative studies have been performed in the visual system. The early visual areas V1, V2 and V3, as well as the motion area MT are conserved in humans. Beyond these areas, differences between human and monkey functional organization are increasingly evident. At the regional level, the monkey inferotemporal and intraparietal complexes appear to be conserved in humans, but there are profound functional differences in the intraparietal cortex suggesting that not all its constituent areas are homologous. In the long term, fMRI offers opportunities to compare the functional anatomy of a variety of cognitive functions in the two species.},

abstract = {Image category recognition is important to access visual information on the level of objects and scene types. So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge.},

abstract = {Five important trends have emerged from recent work on computational models of focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based control of attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.},

@article{Elad2006a,
abstract = {We address the image denoising problem, where zero-mean white and homogeneous Gaussian additive noise is to be removed from a given image. The approach taken is based on sparse and redundant representations over trained dictionaries. Using the K-SVD algorithm, we obtain a dictionary that describes the image content effectively. Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself, or training on a corpus of high-quality image database. Since the K-SVD is limited in handling small image patches, we extend its deployment to arbitrary image sizes by defining a global image prior that forces sparsity over patches in every location in the image. We show how such Bayesian treatment leads to a simple and effective denoising algorithm. This leads to a state-of-the-art denoising performance, equivalent and sometimes surpassing recently published leading alternative denoising methods.},

abstract = {We propose a sequential information maximization model as a general strategy for programming eye movements. The model reconstructs high-resolution visual information from a sequence of fixations, taking into account the fall-off in resolution from the fovea to the periphery. From this framework we get a simple rule for predicting fixation sequences: after each fixation, fixate next at the location that minimizes uncertainty (maximizes information) about the stimulus. By comparing our model performance to human eye movement data and to predictions from a saliency and random model, we demonstrate that our model is best at predicting fixation locations. Modeling additional biological constraints will improve the prediction of fixation sequences. Our results suggest that information maximization is a useful principle for programming eye movements.},

abstract = {High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such "autoencoder" networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.},

abstract = {Objects in the natural world possess different visual attributes, including shape, colour, surface texture and motion. Previous perceptual studies have assumed that the brain analyses the colour of a surface independently of its three-dimensional shape and viewing geometry, although there are neural connections between colour and two-dimensional form processing early in the visual pathway. Here we show that colour perception is strongly influenced by three-dimensional shape perception in a novel, chromatic version of the Mach Card--a concave folded card with one side made of magenta paper and the other of white paper. The light reflected from the magenta paper casts a pinkish glow on the white side. The perceived colour of the white side changes from pale pink to deep magenta when the perceived shape of the card flips from concave to convex. The effect demonstrates that the human visual system incorporates knowledge of mutual illumination-the physics of light reflection between surfaces--at an early stage in colour perception.},

@article{Najemnik2005,
abstract = {To perform visual search, humans, like many mammals, encode a large field of view with retinas having variable spatial resolution, and then use high-speed eye movements to direct the highest-resolution region, the fovea, towards potential target locations. Good search performance is essential for survival, and hence mammals may have evolved efficient strategies for selecting fixation locations. Here we address two questions: what are the optimal eye movement strategies for a foveated visual system faced with the problem of finding a target in a cluttered environment, and do humans employ optimal eye movement strategies during a search? We derive the ideal bayesian observer for search tasks in which a target is embedded at an unknown location within a random background that has the spectral characteristics of natural scenes. Our ideal searcher uses precise knowledge about the statistics of the scenes in which the target is embedded, and about its own visual system, to make eye movements that gain the most information about target location. We find that humans achieve nearly optimal search performance, even though humans integrate information poorly across fixations. Analysis of the ideal searcher reveals that there is little benefit from perfect integration across fixations--much more important is efficient processing of information on each fixation. Apparently, evolution has exploited this fact to achieve efficient eye movement strategies with minimal neural resources devoted to memory.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a neural network model that has an ability to restore missing portions of partly occluded patterns. It is a multi-layered hierarchical neural network, in which visual information is processed by interaction of bottom-up and top-down signals. Memories of learned patterns are stored in the connections between cells. Occluded parts of a pattern are reconstructed mainly by top-down signals from higher stages of the network, while the unoccluded parts are reproduced mainly by signals from lower stages. The restoration progresses successfully, even if the occluded pattern is a deformed version of a learned pattern. The model tries to complete even an unlearned pattern by interpolating and extrapolating visible edges. Resemblance of local features to other learned patterns are also utilized for the restoration.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compare the performance of descriptors computed for local interest regions, as, for example, extracted by the Harris-Affine detector. Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context, steerable filters, PCA-SIFT, differential invariants, spin images, SIFT, complex filters, moment invariants, and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors.},

@article{Li2010,
abstract = {Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a commonly adopted mathematical framework for solving planning problems in stochastic environments. However, computing the optimal policy of POMDP for large-scale problems is known to be intractable, where the high dimensionality of the underlying belief space is one of the major causes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates two different approaches for reducing the dimensionality of the belief space: 1) belief compression and 2) value-directed compression. In particular, a novel orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization is derived for the belief compression, which is then integrated in a value-directed framework for computing the policy. In addition, with the conjecture that a properly partitioned belief space can have its per-cluster intrinsic dimension further reduced, we propose to apply a k-means-like clustering technique to partition the belief space to form a set of sub-POMDPs before applying the dimension reduction techniques to each of them. We have evaluated the proposed belief compression and clustering approaches based on a set of benchmark problems and demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing the cost for computing policies, with the quality of the policies being retained.},

@article{Amit2004,
abstract = {Multiclass shape detection, in the sense of recognizing and localizing instances from multiple shape classes, is formulated as a two-step process in which local indexing primes global interpretation. During indexing a list of instantiations (shape identities and poses) is compiled, constrained only by no missed detections at the expense of false positives. Global information, such as expected relationships among poses, is incorporated afterward to remove ambiguities. This division is motivated by computational efficiency. In addition, indexing itself is organized as a coarse-to-fine search simultaneously in class and pose. This search can be interpreted as successive approximations to likelihood ratio tests arising from a simple ("naive Bayes") statistical model for the edge maps extracted from the original images. The key to constructing efficient "hypothesis tests" for multiple classes and poses is local ORing; in particular, spread edges provide imprecise but common and locally invariant features. Natural tradeoffs then emerge between discrimination and the pattern of spreading. These are analyzed mathematically within the model-based framework and the whole procedure is illustrated by experiments in reading license plates.},

@article{Murray2004,
abstract = {Visual perception involves the grouping of individual elements into coherent patterns, such as object representations, that reduce the descriptive complexity of a visual scene. The computational and physiological bases of this perceptual remain poorly understood. We discuss recent fMRI evidence from our laboratory where we measured activity in a higher object processing area (LOC), and in primary visual cortex (V1) in response to visual elements that were either grouped into objects or randomly arranged. We observed significant activity increases in the LOC and concurrent reductions of activity in V1 when elements formed coherent shapes, suggesting that activity in early visual areas is reduced as a result of grouping processes performed in higher areas. In light of these results we review related empirical findings of context-dependent changes in activity, recent neurophysiology research related to cortical feedback, and computational models that incorporate feedback operations. We suggest that feedback from high-level visual areas reduces activity in lower areas in order to simplify the description of a visual image-consistent with both predictive coding models of perception and probabilistic notions of 'explaining away.'},

@article{Lewicki2000,
abstract = {In an overcomplete basis, the number of basis vectors is greater than the dimensionality of the input, and the representation of an input is not a unique combination of basis vectors. Overcomplete representations have been advocated because they have greater robustness in the presence of noise, can be sparser, and can have greater flexibility in matching structure in the data. Overcomplete codes have also been proposed as a model of some of the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Previous work has focused on finding the best representation of a signal using a fixed overcomplete basis (or dictionary). We present an algorithm for learning an overcomplete basis by viewing it as probabilistic model of the observed data. We show that overcomplete bases can yield a better approximation of the underlying statistical distribution of the data and can thus lead to greater coding efficiency. This can be viewed as a generalization of the technique of independent component analysis and provides a method for Bayesian reconstruction of signals in the presence of noise and for blind source separation when there are more sources than mixtures.},
