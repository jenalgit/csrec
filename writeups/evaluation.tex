\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

The CouchSurfing dataset was made available to the authors in the form of an anonymized MySQL database dump.
As shown in \autoref{fig:requests_distribution}, the distribution of number of requests received is roughly logarithmic on a logarithmic scale.

\todo{summary of statistics about the data, nr surfers/hosts/couchrequests, nr competitorsets, distribution over size of competitorsets}

\todo{Evaluation measures: prediction accuracy, mean normalized rank of winner}

\todo{Baselines: [so far we have some code for random baseline + allreject baseline but nothing more fancy, also CS hasn't responded to our email]}

\todo{Results (In progress.)}
