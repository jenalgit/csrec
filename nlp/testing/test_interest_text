I am a news and political junkie--although lately those 2 things have been looking sort of grim; in which case I'll resort to philosophical conversations about those things. ;) I LOVE Trance music, as I was once a Lighting Technician for nightclubs in Los Angeles and Chicago, and dabbled as a DJ. I enjoy walking too. I know that sounds like something one might take for granted, but I am looking forward to being in a new city, where you can actually be a pedestrian. It's great exercise! :)
$
I like doing crazy and fun stuff, and on other days I just like to be lazy. But all in all I do everything to get experiences and meet interesting people!
$
arts & craft, drawing & painting, museum, theater, dance (contemporary dance, tango, flamenco, etc), sports (soccer, football, volleyball, swimming, kayaking), camping, cooking, architecture, history, traveling, reading, friends and people that interest me, and more
$
I'm pretty active, so I like to run, weight train, practice yoga, cook, listen to music, meet new, and interesting people, and all around enjoy new things.
$
