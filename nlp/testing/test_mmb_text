I do light reading: magazines, online news sources, etc. I'm not much of a book reader. Never really have been. I always feel like I'm missing something in the real world if I'm lost in a book on the couch. The same can be said for movies. I have some faves though such as: The Abyss (director's cut), The Matrix. Sci-fi stuff and Adventure. I like any music that I can shake my ass to, and I have an aversion to rap and hip hop. I need a melody with nice vocals; not some guy mumbling against a repetitive drum machine. That's just my taste.

Selfmade musik and movies with a good story..

Music: I like all kinds of music. I will enjoy one more than others depends on my mood and the occasions. I don’t know many things about music, but I know I music make my life complete. 
jack's Mannequin, Switchfoot, cold play, froster the people, sara bareille, Ingrid michaelson, evanescence, and more. 

Movie: I like indi, chick-flick, action, comedy, documentary, drama and sifi (sometimes). When I am stressed, I love to watch movies that can de-stress me, such as chick-flicks, comedies, and action movies. I love to watch movies that I need to think, movies that have deeper meanings behind the plot, such as documentaries, dramas, and indi movies. 

Books: For novels, I mostly read romantic comedy kind of novels, Sophie Kinsella’s non-shopaholic books. I got A Dirty Job by Christopher Moore from a close friend roughly a month ago, and started to read more other different kinds of friction. I am also reading The Fountainhead at the same time. A good friend recommended it to me back in last fall. He told me I’ll understand more about life when I finish it. Life it is not just about job and boys. I like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Oh, I am a big fan of Harry Potter. 
For non-friction, I am readying Tina Fey’s Bossypants. It is quite funny.
