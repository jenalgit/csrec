Movies: My sister and I really enjoy movies. Anything from Shawshank Redemption to The Darjeeling Limited to the Indiana Jones movies to Ghost Busters to Hitari to ... the list goes on. 
MUSIC: Almost anything and everything with a good beat. Recently have gotten into Andrew Bird/ Rodrigo y Gabriela/ Ratatat. Jack Johnson always hits the spot when its nice out.
